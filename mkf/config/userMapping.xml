 NAME
 userMapping.xml - List user's type mapping between two or more
 languages.  
 
 DESCRIPTION
 This file is use during wrapping processes. Developpers can adjust target
 language types given source types.
 To be taken into account, the developper must realize  that the userMapping.xml
 file is located in the same directory as xslt used files. To be sure that this
 file can be editable, one workaround is to install the mkf module and copy the
 proper userMapping file into the $INTROOT/config directory.

 EXAMPLES
