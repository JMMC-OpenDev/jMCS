* Normal documentation block : with 1 stars at the begining
*       /*
*        *
*        */
* Nevertheless, you also have to comment the code as usually.  For more
* informations, you can report to Programming Standards (JRA4-PRO-2000-0001),
* or doxygen documentation.
*
* REMARKS
* The documentation below, shows some possibilities of doxygen. The general
* format of this documentation is recommended to make the documentation
