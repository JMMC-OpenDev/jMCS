\mainpage 'Log' : MCS C Logging module

<b>Brief description</b>\n
This module provides functionnalities to handle the 2 most common types of
logs for event logging, that are :
  \li \em File logs   (stored in files on disk);
  \li \em Stdout logs (directly written on stdout).\n\n

<b>Detailed decription</b>\n
To achieve logging, this module is separated in two component :
  \li the \em 'log' library : your code must use it to handle any of the 2 most common log types you need;
  \li the \em 'logManager' daemon : process responsible for writting in files all the events your code logs.\n\n

Note that the 'log' library delegates file logging to the logManager through a network connection, so this daemon can be a remote process of your development computer.
