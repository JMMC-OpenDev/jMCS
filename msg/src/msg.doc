/**
\mainpage 'Msg' : Inter-Process Network Messages Exchange Management

<b>Brief description</b>\n
This module provides functionnalities to handle inter-process communication based on messages exchange through an IPv4 network.

<b>Detailed decription</b>\n
To achieve the communication, this module is separated in 2 components :
  \li the \em 'msg' library : your code must use it to handle any inter-process network communication;
  \li the \em 'msgManager' daemon : process responsible for processes name registration, and message forwarding between those processes.\n\n

Note that the 'msgManager' daemon extensively use the notion of MCS Environment, in the way that each environment can run its own version of 'msgManager'.

\todo Verify that this module is completly 'localhost endianess' independant (e.g extensive use of htons())
