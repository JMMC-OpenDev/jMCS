/**
\mainpage evh : event handling toolkit 

\ddesc
This module provides a set of classes to implement event driven applications;
i.e based on an event handler. The event handler tells the program how to act
in response to a specific event (e.g. receiving a command). 

The following types of events are handled:
	- Command         
	- Reply
	- I/O available from unix file descriptors

The core of the toolkit is the evhHANDLER class. It is an event dispatcher that
receives events, and calls methods which have been attached to handle those
events.
